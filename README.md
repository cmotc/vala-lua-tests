Vala->Lua/Lua->Vala Experimentation and Notes folder.
=====================================================

This is a place where I'm experimenting with how Lua can be embedded in Vala and
how Vala can be called from Lua.

First task, finding out how to load a lua file containing lua function
definitions, and then call those functions from within vala code.
