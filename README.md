Vala->Lua/Lua->Vala Experimentation and Notes folder.
=====================================================

This is a place where I'm experimenting with how Lua can be embedded in Vala and
how Vala can be called from Lua.

OK so I've learned a bit, next experiment is the most important one so far and
it's delegates. I'm working on editing my notes into more details, and
incorporating the code samples into the automatically generated html.
