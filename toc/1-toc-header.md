My Totally Non-Authoritative Experiments and Conclusions about Vala->Lua/Lua->Vala
==================================================================================

This is a web site I set up to record my observations into using Lua within Vala
and Vala within Lua in a way that is organizable. Embedding Lua into a compiled,
program in a C-Like programming language is relatively easy, but it's still
linking a scripting language into a compiled C-Like program. It's still pretty
complicated. It's not much more than notes and code, and that's all it'll be for
a while, but I'll keep at it.
